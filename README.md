# Olivia's Pokédex
[pokemon-pokedex](https://oliviawissig.com/)

### Overview
A website created from scratch that <sup>mostly</sup> recreates Pokémon's current [Pokédex page](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex). I created this project to showcase my ability to use RESTful APIs, like [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and my pixel-perfect accuracy. 

I learned/improved on:
- Using hooks and `useEffect()` to handle animations and more
- Breaking down REST APIs to get the information I need
- Using Javascript & CSS to style a large number of elements with many differences
- Changing elements and their appearances in different queries and environments
